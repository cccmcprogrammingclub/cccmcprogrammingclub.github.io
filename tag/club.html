</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>Welcome to CCCMC's programming club. Strap in, because we will be moving fast.</p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<ul>
<li>Learn the basics of computer programming languages and to <em>learn by doing</em></li>
<li>Provide time and atmosphere to collaborate and create your own projects</li>
<li>Provide access to relevent infromation for computer programming classes and careers</li>
<li>Make things!</li>
</ul>
<p>We will use the Python 2.7 programming language. Python 3 is out and works great, but for the purposes of learning we will use the older code since it has more robust support online.</p>
<p>Note that I am only requiring Python to be used for learning purposes. Once you are on your own projects, I do not care which language you use. Ask me if you need guidance in choosing a language.</p>
<h2>Resources</h2>
<h3>Python</h3>
<ul>
<li>Install python 2.7.12 <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">here</a>. Do not install it on the school computers.</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.python.org/2.7/">Python 2.7 Documentation</a></li>
<li>Because we cannot install stuff onto the school computers, we will be using <a href="https://repl.it">Repl.it</a> in club sessions at first. Make an account on Repl.it and join my class <a href="https://repl.it/classroom/invite/RWT5Hh">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Learning</h3>
<p>The following links are useful for taking online classes, tutorials, or for code reference. I suggest taking a class in Codecademy or Udacity in your spare time <strong>as long as it does not affect your school work! School comes first!</strong></p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="www.codecademy.com">Codecademy</a></li>
<li><a href="www.udacity.com">Udacity</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line">Command Line Class</a> This is a class to teach you the basics of the Bash command line, which is included in most linux/unix and Mac (OSX) distributions. It is a <em>must know</em> for working in programming, systems, and networking. Google, for example, wants its employees to know linux command line. This will feel like you have been transported back into the 1970s.</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spr05/cos126/cmd-prompt.html">Windows Command Line Class</a> Like the above, but for windows command line.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/cccmcprogrammingclub">CCCMC Programming Club Github</a> I will put code snippets here.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Text Editors</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/3">Sublime Text 3</a> - I suggest this text editor, as I will often use it during class.</li>
<li><a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a> - If you hate sublime for some reason, Notepad++ is also great</li>
<li><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/">JetBrains</a> If you want to bug JetBrains for a free educational copy of their IDE (Interactive Development Environment), feel free. I will not be using these on the projector due to their complexity.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Tools</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> Git is a version control system. I'll write a tutorial sometime, but there are tons of them online. Once you get comfortable coding, start using Git to store your progress. It makes life infinitely simpler.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com">Github</a> This is a place to host and store your code in a git repository. Make a github account so I can see your code and help out! :)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Gamedev</h3>
<p>I know many of you want to make games. I suggest starting with Pygame for the basics, or Unity if you want a more full featured program. I do not know Unity, so I cannot really help you there.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="http://pygame.org">Pygame</a></li>
<li><a href="https://unity3d.com/">Unity</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Note that programming can quickly get overwhelming. This is a relatively new field in the long run of things, and it advances quickly. Try not to be too intimidated, but you will learn something. Go at your own pace and figure this stuff out and see if you like it. I will be here to assist.</p>
